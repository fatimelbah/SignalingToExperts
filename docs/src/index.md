# My Replication of xyz

> This replication study was part of my evaluation for the course [Numerical Methods](https://floswald.github.io/NumericalMethods/) at SciencesPo Paris in Spring 2021

In this replication study, we tried to replicate the numerical simulation done in the "Signaling to Experts" paper and use them to generate the figures. We were unfortunately unable to generate the paper's figures. the functions to create these figures were all working and we verified their output compared to the matlab output and found the same results.
